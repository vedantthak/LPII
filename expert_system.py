# Viva Questions and Answers (Short)
# Q: What is the purpose of this system?
# A: To diagnose possible diseases based on symptoms and manage patient history and resource availability.

# Q: How does the system diagnose a disease?
# A: It compares input symptoms with predefined disease symptoms and picks the one with the highest match.

# Q: How are symptoms matched to diseases?
# A: Using a score system that counts the number of matching symptoms for each disease.

# Q: What happens if no symptoms match any disease?
# A: The system returns "Unknown Condition" and suggests consulting a doctor.

# Q: How are emergency cases handled?
# A: The system checks for critical symptoms like "chest pain" or "shortness of breath" and triggers an emergency alert.

# Q: What information is stored in patient history?
# A: Symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment are stored for each patient under their name.

# Q: How does the system handle multiple records for the same patient?
# A: It appends new records to the existing list under the patient‚Äôs name.

# Q: What is the use of check_resources()?
# A: It returns the number of beds and doctors available in the hospital.

# Q: Can a user retrieve their past medical data?
# A: Yes, using the "View patient history" option with the patient‚Äôs name.

# Q: What data structures are used in this system?
# A: Dictionaries (for rules and history) and lists (for symptoms and records).
