# Viva Questions and Answers
# What is the purpose of the is_safe function?

# The is_safe function checks whether it is safe to color a node with a particular color by ensuring that none of its neighbors have the same color.

# What is the role of backtracking in this code?

# Backtracking is used to explore all possible color assignments. If a valid coloring is not possible with a given color, the algorithm undoes the assignment and tries the next possibility.

# What happens if a solution does not exist?

# If no valid coloring can be found, the program prints "Solution does not exist."

# What is the input format for this program?

# The program accepts the number of vertices, the number of colors, and the edges of the graph. Each edge is represented by two integers, denoting an edge between two vertices.

# How does the program determine whether a solution exists?

# The program uses backtracking to try all possible colorings of the graph. If a valid coloring is found, the program prints the assigned colors; otherwise, it concludes that no solution exists.

# Can this program work for any graph?

# The program can work for any graph, but it will only work if the number of colors provided (m) is sufficient to color the graph without two adjacent nodes sharing the same color. If m is too small, the solution might not exist.

# What does the graph_coloring_util function do?

# The graph_coloring_util function is a recursive function that tries to assign colors to each vertex, checking if it is safe to do so. If it encounters a conflict, it backtracks and tries a different color.

# What is the role of the color array?

# The color array holds the current color assigned to each vertex. A 0 indicates that a vertex has not been colored yet.

# What is the worst-case time complexity of this algorithm?

# The worst-case time complexity is O(m^n), where m is the number of colors and n is the number of vertices. This is because for each vertex, the algorithm may try all m colors, leading to an exponential growth of possibilities.

# How would you improve the efficiency of this algorithm?

# To improve efficiency, heuristics like choosing the next node with the most constraints or using more advanced algorithms (such as greedy algorithms) could reduce the number of recursive calls.
