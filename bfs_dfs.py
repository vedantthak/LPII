# Sure! Here's a line-by-line detailed explanation of the code you've posted, which implements a graph and performs both DFS (Depth First Search) and BFS (Breadth First Search):

# ðŸ”¹ from collections import deque
# Imports deque, a double-ended queue from the collections module.

# deque is faster than lists for queue operations like append and popleft, which is useful in BFS.

# ðŸ”¹ class Graph:
# Defines a class called Graph to represent the graph data structure and its operations.

# ðŸ”¹ def __init__(self):
# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     self.graph = {}
# This is the constructor method.

# Initializes an empty dictionary self.graph to store the adjacency list of the graph.

# Each key is a node, and its value is a list of connected nodes (neighbors).

# ðŸ”¹ def add_edge(self, u, v):
# Adds an edge between nodes u and v.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     if u not in self.graph:
#         self.graph[u] = []
# If u is not already in the graph, initialize its list of neighbors.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     if v not in self.graph:
#         self.graph[v] = []
# Same for v.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     self.graph[u].append(v)
#     self.graph[v].append(u)
# Adds v to uâ€™s neighbor list and u to vâ€™s list â€” i.e., undirected edge.

# âœ… If the graph were directed, you'd remove the second line.

# ðŸ”¹ def dfs(self, start, visited=None):
# This defines the DFS traversal function.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     if visited is None:
#         visited = set()
# If no visited set is provided, initialize a new empty set.

# This tracks all visited nodes to avoid infinite recursion.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     visited.add(start)
#     print(start, end=" ")
# Mark the current node start as visited.

# Print it to show traversal order.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     for neighbour in self.graph.get(start, []):
#         if neighbour not in visited:
#             self.dfs(neighbour, visited)
# Iterate over each neighbor of the current node.

# If a neighbor hasnâ€™t been visited, call dfs recursively on it.

# ðŸ”¹ def bfs(self, start):
# This defines the BFS traversal function.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     visited = set()
#     visited.add(start)
#     queue = deque([start])
# Initialize an empty set for visited nodes.

# Mark the starting node as visited.

# Use a deque to initialize the queue with the starting node.

# ðŸ”¹ Nested bfs_helper() function:
# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     def bfs_helper():
# Defines a helper function for recursion. This is a recursive BFS, which is unusual (typically BFS uses loops).

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#         if not queue:
#             return
# Base case: if the queue is empty, stop recursion.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#         vertex = queue.popleft()
#         print(vertex, end=" ")
# Dequeue the next node, print it.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#         for neighbour in self.graph.get(vertex, []):

#                 visited.add(neighbour)
#                 queue.append(neighbour)
# For each unvisited neighbor, mark as visited and enqueue it.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#         bfs_helper()
# Recurse with updated queue until all reachable nodes are visited.

# ðŸ”¹ def main():
# Defines the main() function where you would create a graph and call its methods.

# python
# Copy
# Edit
#     g = Graph()
# Creates an instance of the Graph class.

# Let me know if you'd like me to add interactive input to build a graph and perform BFS/DFS.

# Viva Questions and Answers:
# 1. What is the difference between DFS and BFS?
# DFS (Depth First Search) explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It uses a stack (either explicitly or through recursion) to explore nodes.

# BFS (Breadth First Search) explores all the neighbors of a node before moving to the next level. It uses a queue to explore nodes level by level.

# 2. What data structure is used in DFS and BFS?
# DFS: A stack is used (either explicitly or implicitly through recursion).

# BFS: A queue is used to explore nodes level by level.

# 3. How does the recursive approach in DFS work?
# DFS starts at a node, marks it as visited, and recursively visits all unvisited neighbors, backtracking when necessary. This continues until all reachable nodes are visited.

# 4. What is the time complexity of DFS and BFS?
# DFS and BFS both have a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

# 5. Why is the visited set used in DFS and BFS?
# The visited set ensures that nodes are not revisited, preventing infinite loops in cyclic graphs and ensuring each node is processed only once.

# 6. How does the graph structure affect DFS and BFS?
# DFS: Can go deep into the graph along one branch, making it useful for pathfinding and solving puzzles.

# BFS: Explores level by level, which makes it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

# 7. What is the role of recursion in DFS?
# Recursion allows DFS to explore nodes deeply without the need for an explicit stack. Each recursive call represents a deeper exploration of the graph.

# 8. Why is BFS unusual in the provided code with recursion?
# BFS is typically implemented using a queue and iteration, but in the provided code, BFS uses recursion by defining a bfs_helper function to mimic the iterative process.

# Space Complexity in Short:
# DFS (Depth First Search):

# Recursive: O(V) (due to recursion stack and visited nodes)

# Non-recursive: O(V) (due to the stack and visited nodes)

# BFS (Breadth First Search): O(V) (due to the queue and visited nodes)

# Where V is the number of vertices in the graph.

# Total edges to add:	6
# EDGE 1 ->
# Enter first vertex for edge 1: a
# Enter second vertex for edge 1: b
# EDGE 2 ->
# Enter first vertex for edge 2: a
# Enter second vertex for edge 2: c
# EDGE 3 ->
# Enter first vertex for edge 3: b
# Enter second vertex for edge 3: d
# EDGE 4 ->
# Enter first vertex for edge 4: c
# Enter second vertex for edge 4: e
# EDGE 5 ->
# Enter first vertex for edge 5: d
# Enter second vertex for edge 5: f
# EDGE 6 ->
# Enter first vertex for edge 6: e
# Enter second vertex for edge 6: g
