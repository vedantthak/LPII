# Viva Questions and Answers:
# What is the goal state in the 8-puzzle problem?
# Answer: The goal state is a 3x3 grid arranged as:

# Copy
# Edit
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 0
# Where 0 represents the blank space.

# What heuristic function is used in this implementation?
# Answer: The Manhattan distance heuristic is used, which calculates the sum of the vertical and horizontal distances of each tile from its goal position.

# What is the purpose of the find_blank() function?
# Answer: The find_blank() function locates the position of the blank space (represented by 0) in the puzzle to facilitate the movement of tiles.

# How does the move() function work?
# Answer: The move() function generates a new state after moving the blank space in one of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), provided the move stays within the bounds of the grid.

# What is the role of the to_tuple() function?
# Answer: The to_tuple() function converts a 2D list (the puzzle state) into a tuple of tuples, making it hashable, which is necessary for using it as a key in dictionaries (like came_from and g_score).

# How does A use the open list (priority queue)?*
# Answer: The open list is a priority queue (min-heap) that stores the states to be explored, sorted by the f value (calculated as g + h), ensuring that the most promising state is expanded first.

# What is stored in the came_from dictionary?
# Answer: The came_from dictionary stores the parent state and the direction from which the state was reached, allowing us to reconstruct the path from the goal to the start.

# What happens if no solution is found in the A search?*
# Answer: If no solution is found, the function returns None, and the program prints "No solution found."

# What is the space complexity of the A algorithm in this implementation?*
# Answer: The space complexity is O(b^d), where b is the branching factor (maximum number of possible moves from a given state), and d is the depth of the solution (maximum number of moves in the solution path).

# What is the time complexity of the A algorithm in this implementation?*
# Answer: The time complexity is O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the solution depth. The A* algorithm explores all possible states up to the solution depth.

# Why do we use a priority queue in A?*
# Answer: A priority queue is used to always explore the most promising states first by sorting nodes based on their f value (which is the sum of the cost to reach the node and the heuristic estimate).

# How do we ensure the moves are valid in this implementation?
# Answer: The move() function checks if the new state after a move is within the valid boundaries (0 â‰¤ row, col < 3), ensuring that no invalid moves are made.

# What happens if you enter an unsolvable puzzle state?
# Answer: If the puzzle is unsolvable (i.e., there is no solution), the program will output "No solution found."

# What does the output Total moves: 8 signify?
# Answer: The output indicates that the optimal solution to reach the goal state from the initial state requires 8 moves.
