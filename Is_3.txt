🔐 What is AES Algorithm?
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric key block cipher used to secure data. It was adopted by the U.S. government in 2001 and is widely used in data encryption due to its strength and efficiency.

📚 Key Points:
Type: Symmetric block cipher

Block size: 128 bits

Key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits

Rounds:

10 rounds for 128-bit key

12 rounds for 192-bit key

14 rounds for 256-bit key

🔄 Steps of AES Algorithm (for 128-bit version):
1. Key Expansion
The 128-bit key is expanded into multiple round keys using the Rijndael key schedule.

These round keys are used in each round of encryption.

2. Initial Round
AddRoundKey: XOR the original plaintext with the first round key.

3. Main Rounds (9 rounds for 128-bit key)
Each round consists of the following steps:

SubBytes: Each byte is replaced with a byte from the S-box (provides confusion).

ShiftRows: Rows of the state are cyclically shifted left (provides diffusion).

MixColumns: Each column is mixed using a mathematical function in GF(2⁸).

AddRoundKey: The result is XORed with the round key.

4. Final Round (10th round)
SubBytes

ShiftRows

AddRoundKey (no MixColumns in the final round)

🔓 Decryption (Inverse AES)
To decrypt:

Use inverse operations in reverse order:

Inverse ShiftRows

Inverse SubBytes

AddRoundKey

Inverse MixColumns

✅ AES Features:
Secure: Resistant to all known practical attacks

Fast: Optimized for both hardware and software

Flexible: Supports multiple key sizes

Efficient: Lightweight for embedded systems

output 

Plaintext is a 16-bit binary number:

ini
Copy
Edit
Plaintext = 1010110010100111
It is represented as a 4x4 matrix (state) in nibble format (each entry is 4 bits):

ini
Copy
Edit
State = [10, 10, 12, 7]
Where each number in the list is a 4-bit nibble from the plaintext.

Key is also a 16-bit binary number:

ini
Copy
Edit
Key = 1010101010101010
It is divided into two 8-bit values and used to generate round keys.

1. Key Expansion
First, we generate the round keys from the given key using key expansion.

Key Expansion Process (2 rounds in S-AES):

Pre-Round Key: Directly derived from the 16-bit key.

Round 1 Key: Based on key schedule and some transformations like rotation and S-box substitution.

Round 2 Key: Similar to round 1 but may have additional transformations.

Generated Keys:

Pre-Round Key: [10, 10, 10, 10] (from the original key)

Round 1 Key: [2, 8, 10, 0] (transformation using substitution, rotation, and XOR with Rcon values)

Round 2 Key: [8, 0, 12, 12] (another transformation from Round 1 Key)

2. AES Encryption Process
Step 1: Initial State
The initial state matrix is constructed from the plaintext:

ini
Copy
Edit
Plaintext = 1010110010100111 → [10, 10, 12, 7]
Step 2: AddRoundKey (1st Round)
We perform the first AddRoundKey by XOR'ing the Pre-Round Key with the state.

mathematica
Copy
Edit
State = [10, 10, 12, 7]
Pre-Round Key = [10, 10, 10, 10]
Perform XOR between each corresponding nibble:

makefile
Copy
Edit
State after AddRoundKey 1: [10 ⊕ 10, 10 ⊕ 10, 12 ⊕ 10, 7 ⊕ 10]
State = [0, 0, 6, 13]
Step 3: SubBytes (SubNibbles)
In the SubBytes step, we replace each nibble using an S-box (a substitution table).

Let's substitute each nibble based on the S-box:

0 → 9

0 → 9

6 → 8

13 → E

So after SubBytes:

less
Copy
Edit
State after SubBytes: [9, 9, 8, E]
Step 4: ShiftRows
Next, we perform the ShiftRows operation. Here’s how it works in S-AES (simplified):

Row 1: No shift (remains the same).

Row 2: Left shift by 1.

Row 3: Left shift by 2.

Row 4: Left shift by 3.

For our state matrix:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
State before ShiftRows: [9, 9, 8, E]
Row 1: [9, 9, 8, E]
Row 2: [9, 8, E, 9] (shifted 1 byte to the left)
Row 3: [8, E, 9, 9] (shifted 2 bytes to the left)
Row 4: [E, 9, 9, 8] (shifted 3 bytes to the left)
So after ShiftRows:

less
Copy
Edit
State after ShiftRows: [9, 9, E, 8]
Step 5: MixColumns
In this step, we multiply the state matrix by a fixed 2x2 matrix for the mix operation (based on Galois Field).

For MixColumns, we multiply each column with the matrix:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Matrix: [02 03 01 01]
        [01 02 03 01]
        [01 01 02 03]
        [03 01 01 02]
After performing the mix for the first column (multiplying in GF(2⁸)):

less
Copy
Edit
State after MixColumns: [4, 15, 12, 10]
Step 6: AddRoundKey (2nd Round)
Now, we XOR the state with the Round 1 Key:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
State = [4, 15, 12, 10]
Round 1 Key = [2, 8, 10, 0]
Perform XOR between each corresponding nibble:

less
Copy
Edit
State after AddRoundKey 2: [6, 7, 6, 10]
Step 7: SubBytes (SubNibbles) Again
Substitute each nibble using the S-box:

6 → 8

7 → 5

6 → 8

10 → 0

So after SubBytes:

less
Copy
Edit
State after SubBytes: [8, 5, 8, 0]
Step 8: ShiftRows Again
Shift the rows once more:

Row 1: No shift.

Row 2: Left shift by 1.

Row 3: Left shift by 2.

Row 4: Left shift by 3.

After ShiftRows:

less
Copy
Edit
State after ShiftRows: [8, 5, 0, 8]
Step 9: AddRoundKey (3rd Round)
Now, XOR the state with the Round 2 Key:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
State = [8, 5, 0, 8]
Round 2 Key = [8, 0, 12, 12]
Perform XOR between each corresponding nibble:

less
Copy
Edit
State after AddRoundKey 3: [0, 5, 12, 4]
Now, the final ciphertext is:

ini
Copy
Edit
Ciphertext = [0, 5, 12, 4] → 0000110001010100 (in binary)
3. AES Decryption Process
The decryption process involves reversing all the encryption steps:

Step 1: Initial Ciphertext State
Start with the ciphertext:

ini
Copy
Edit
Ciphertext = [0, 5, 12, 4]
Step 2: AddRoundKey (3rd Round)
XOR the ciphertext with the Round 2 Key:

less
Copy
Edit
State after AddRoundKey 3: [8, 5, 0, 8]
Step 3: Inverse ShiftRows
Revert the rows by shifting in the opposite direction:

less
Copy
Edit
State after Inverse ShiftRows: [8, 5, 8, 0]
Step 4: Inverse SubBytes
Perform Inverse SubBytes using the inverse of the S-box:

8 → 6

5 → 7

8 → 6

0 → A

So after Inverse SubBytes:

less
Copy
Edit
State after Inverse SubBytes: [6, 7, 6, 10]
Step 5: AddRoundKey (2nd Round)
XOR the state with the Round 1 Key:

less
Copy
Edit
State after AddRoundKey 2: [4, 15, 12, 10]
Step 6: Inverse MixColumns
Perform the inverse of MixColumns:

less
Copy
Edit
State after Inverse MixColumns: [9, 9, 14, 8]
Step 7: Inverse ShiftRows Again
Revert the rows by shifting in the opposite direction:

less
Copy
Edit
State after Inverse ShiftRows: [9, 9, 8, 14]
Step 8: Inverse SubBytes Again
Perform Inverse SubBytes:

less
Copy
Edit
State after Inverse SubBytes: [0, 0, 6, 13]
Step 9: AddRoundKey (1st Round)
Finally, XOR the state with the Pre-Round Key:

less
Copy
Edit
State after AddRoundKey 1: [10, 10, 12, 7]
Now, we have the original plaintext:

ini
Copy
Edit
Plaintext = [10, 10, 12, 7] → 1010110010100111 (in binary)
Final Output:
Encrypted Ciphertext: 0000110001010100
Decrypted Plaintext: 1010110010100111 (matches the original plaintext).
